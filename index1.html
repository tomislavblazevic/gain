    <p> An acoustic guitar is a musical
        instrument in the string family. When a string is plucked, its vibration is transmitted from the bridge,
        resonating
        throughout the top of the guitar. It is also transmitted to the side and back of the instrument, resonating
        through
        the air in the body, and producing sound from the sound hole. The original, general term for this stringed
        instrument is guitar, and the retronym 'acoustic guitar' distinguishes it from an electric guitar, which
        relies on
        electronic amplification. Typically, a guitar's body is a sound box, of which the top side serves as a sound
        board
        that enhances the vibration sounds of the strings. In standard tuning the guitar's six strings are tuned
        (low to
        high) E2 A2 D3 G3 B3 E4.

        Guitar strings may be plucked individually with a pick (plectrum) or fingertip, or strummed to play chords.
        Plucking
        a string causes it to vibrate at a fundamental pitch determined by the string's length, mass, and tension.
        (Overtones are also present, closely related to harmonics of the fundamental pitch.) The string causes the
        soundboard and the air enclosed by the sound box to vibrate. As these have their own resonances, they
        amplify some
        overtones more strongly than others, affecting the timbre of the resulting sound.

    <p> The guitar likely originated in Spain in the early 16th century, deriving from the guitarra latina.
        Gitterns, (small, plucked guitars) were the first small, guitar-like instruments created during the Spanish
        Middle
        Ages with a round back, like that of the lute. Modern guitar-shaped instruments were not seen until the
        Renaissance
        era, when the body and size began to take a guitar-like shape.
        A reconstruction of a medieval gittern, the first guitar-like instrument
        The earliest string instruments related to the guitar and its structure were broadly known as vihuelas
        within
        Spanish musical culture. Vihuelas were string instruments that were commonly seen in the 16th century during
        the
        Renaissance. Later, Spanish writers distinguished these instruments into two categories of vihuelas.
    <p>
        <img alt="guitar in the dark on a stand" src="soloacoustic.jpg" height="60%" , width="40%" ;>
    </p>The vihuela de arco was an instrument that mimicked the violin, and the vihuela de Penola was played
        with a plectrum or by hand.
        When it was played by hand it was known as the vihuela de mano. Vihuela de mano shared extreme similarities with
        the
        Renaissance guitar as it used hand movement at the sound hole or sound chamber of the instrument to create
        music.
        By 1790 only six-course vihuela guitars (six unison-tuned pairs of strings) were being created and had become
        the
        main type and model of guitar used in Spain. Most of the older 5-course guitars were still in use but were also
        being modified to a six-coursed acoustical guitar. Fernando Ferandiere's book Arte de tocar la Guitarra Española
        por
        Música (Madrid, 1799) describes the standard Spanish guitar from his time as an instrument with seventeen frets
        and
        six courses with the first two 'gut' strings tuned in unison called the terceras and the tuning named to 'G' of
        the
        two strings. The acoustic guitar at this time began to take the shape familiar in the modern acoustic guitar.
        The
        coursed pairs of strings eventually became less common in favor of single strings.
        Finally, circa 1850, the form and structure of the modern guitar are credited to Spanish guitar maker Antonio
        Torres
        Jurado, who increased the size of the guitar body, altered its proportions, and made use of fan bracing, which
        first
        appeared in guitars made by Francisco Sanguino in the late 18th century. The bracing pattern, which refers to
        the
        internal pattern of wood reinforcements used to secure the guitar's top and back to prevent the instrument from
        collapsing under tension,[ is an important factor in how the guitar sounds. Torres' design greatly improved the
        volume, tone, and projection of the instrument, and it has remained essentially unchanged since.
